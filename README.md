# Let's live young village

Korea has entered the age of aging too quickly. There are now more elderly people than young people, and Korea's fertility rate in 2020 is only 0.84. Of course, it is true that we should focus on the fertility rate and implement various policies to increase the fertility rate, but now that we have entered the age of aging, we need to prepare for the age of aging. So, what I am most interested in and want to succeed is the dementia village. In Korea, it is difficult to receive good attention when it comes to dementia.

I don't know about other countries, so I'm going to briefly talk about dementia in Korea. In Korea, people with dementia are not proud of themselves and are thoroughly isolating the patient and his or her family from society and daily life. What is more shocking is that with the rapid aging of the population, Korea is showing a rapid rate of increase in dementia.

We must accept this fact and escape from the prison of dementia.

Currently, the number of people with dementia in Korea is about 610,000, and 10 years later, Korea will enter a dementia society where more than one million people with dementia must live with.

According to the Korea Central Dementia Center, 1 in 10 seniors over the age of 65 suffers from dementia and is a dementia reserve group with cognitive decline.

However, many people do not know much about dementia, fear it, and have prejudices. Dementia can happen to anyone and you don't have to act like a sinner.

Even more surprising is that the number of people with dementia worldwide increases by one every 4 seconds. That is, an increase of 900 people per hour. Therefore, we need to pay more attention to dementia and think about how to respond.

Therefore, I think that it is necessary to build a dementia village that can care for these things and provide interest and education.

So I became interested in dementia villages, and I think Korea should also build dementia villages. Perhaps the most famous dementia village I have seen is the village of Hogeweyk in the Netherlands. Another is Svendborg, a dementia village in Denmark, and Tasmania, a dementia village in Australia.

Please let me know if anyone is interested in, has advice on, or has experience with these projects. I really want to do it. (Professors, doctors, experts, architects, etc. are all welcome.)
