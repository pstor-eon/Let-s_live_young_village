# Let's live young village

Korea has entered the age of aging too quickly. There are now more elderly people than young people, and Korea's fertility rate in 2020 is only 0.84. Of course, it is true that we should focus on the fertility rate and implement various policies to increase the fertility rate, but now that we have entered the age of aging, we need to prepare for the age of aging. So, what I am most interested in and want to succeed is the dementia village. In Korea, it is difficult to receive good attention when it comes to dementia.

So I became interested in dementia villages, and I think Korea should also build dementia villages. Perhaps the most famous dementia village I have seen is the village of Hogeweyk in the Netherlands. Another is Svendborg, a dementia village in Denmark, and Tasmania, a dementia village in Australia.

Please let me know if anyone is interested in, has advice on, or has experience with these projects. I really want to do it. (Professors, doctors, experts, architects, etc. are all welcome.)
